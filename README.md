# Watson-Knowledge-Studio README
Waston Knowledge Studio is a tool used to create machine-learning models that understands the linguistic nuances, meaning, and relationships specific to your industry or to create a rule-based models that finds entities in documents based on rules that you define.

Watson Knowledge Studio provides easy-to-use tools for annotating unstructured domain literature, and uses those annotations to create a custom machine-learning model that understands the language of the domain. The accuracy of the model improves through iterative testing, ultimately resulting in an algorithm that can learn from the patterns that it sees and recognize those patterns in large collections of new documents. You can deploy the finished machine-learning model to other Watson cloud-based offerings and cognitive solutions to find and extract mentions of relations and entities, including entity coreferences.
